# architecture-is-code

Architecture should not be just a diagram of the ["Separation of Concerns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of a given system. Consistent with the ideal of Continuous Integration, an "Architecture" should be executable and testable in a run-time environment.  This repo is an attempt to demonstrate these assertions.
